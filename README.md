# Teachbook recombiner

This is a web app to pick chapters from a pre-defined list of teach books and combine them into a new book using
the new `external` table of content entry type, see [teachbook package](https://github.com/TeachBooks/TeachBooks/blob/dd2418e0695d42d78a764cb165dd5d77875be6d9/docs/source/external.rst).

## Catalog

In [books.yml](books.yml) you can find the list of books that can be combined.

In [chapters.json](chapters.json) you can find the same books, but with their table of contents fetched.
You should not edit this file manually, as it is generated by the `harvest.py` script.

The `chapters.json` file is generated by running the following command:

```bash
# Install the dependencies, if you haven't already
pnpm install
pnpm harvest
# Reads books.yml and generates chapters.json
```

## Remote catalog

If you want to show other books the then ones specified in the `./books.yml` file, you can point the app to a remote
catalog file with the following steps
1. Create a books.yml file
2. Host it on the Internet and make sure that [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) is enabled.
3. Open app with `http://teachbooks.io/external-content/?books_url=<your_url>`. Where `<your_url>` is the URL of your books.yml file.

## Sharing user defined books

In the web application you can add a book using a form. 

To make those books shareable, you can click the `share` button in header of the books list. This will open a new window with a link in the adress bar. Sharing that link will allow other users to see the books you defined.
