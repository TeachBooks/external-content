# Teachbook recombiner

This is a web app to pick chapters from a pre-defined list of teach books and combine them into a new book using
the new `external` table of content entry type, see [teachbook package](https://github.com/TeachBooks/TeachBooks/blob/dd2418e0695d42d78a764cb165dd5d77875be6d9/docs/source/external.rst).

## Catalog

In [catalog.yml](catalog.yml) you can find the list of books and chapters that can be combined.

In [catalog.json](catalog.json) you can find the same books, but with their table of contents fetched.
You should not edit this file manually, as it is generated by the `harvest.py` script.

The `catalog.json` file is generated by running the following command:

```bash
# Install the dependencies, if you haven't already
pip install -e .
./harvest.py
# The catalog.json file will be generated
```
